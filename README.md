## Commands for using git

    - 'git clone {address}': Clones repository into newly created   directory
    - 'git add .': Adds all files in the working tree (you can also add specific files by replacing the . with the name of the file)
    - 'git commit -m "{message}"': Commits all files that were added, use a meaningful message (i.e. "Fixing responsiveness of the home page")
    - 'git push': Pushes all committed files to github
